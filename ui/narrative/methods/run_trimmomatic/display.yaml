# Configure the display and description of parameters

parameters :
	read_type :
		ui-name : |
			Read Library Type
		short-hint : |
			Library type, paired end or single end sequencing
		long-hint : |
			Library type, paired end or single end sequencing
	input_read_library :
		ui-name : |
			Read Library Object
		short-hint : |
			The read set to examine
		long-hint  : |
			The read set for which you want to trim.
	quality_encoding :
		ui-name : |
			Quality encoding
		short-hint : |
			Read quality encoding format.
		long-hint : |
			Read quality encoding format.
	output_read_library :
		ui-name : |
			Output Library name
		short-hint : |
			Base name for output read library object(s)
		long-hint : |
			Base name for output read library object(s)
	adapterFa :
		ui-name : |
			Adapters
		short-hint : |
			The reference sequences for trimming.
		long-hint : |
			The reference adapter sequences.
	seed_mismatches : 
		ui-name : |
			Seed mismatches
		short-hint : |
			Maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full mismatch.
		long-hint : |
			Specifies the maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match to be performed.
	palindrome_clip_threshold : 
		ui-name : |
			Palindrome clip threshold
		short-hint : |
			Specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment.
		long-hint : |
			Specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment.
	simple_clip_threshold : 
		ui-name : |
			Simple clip threshold
		short-hint : |
			Specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must be against a read.
		long-hint : |
			Specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must be against a read.
	crop_length :
		ui-name : |
			Crop length
		short-hint : |
			The number of bases to keep, from the start of the read.
		long-hint : |
			Removes bases regardless of quality from the end of the read, so that the read has maximally the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the read.
	head_crop_length :
		ui-name : |
			Head Crop length
		short-hint : |
			The number of bases to remove from the start of the read.
		long-hint : |
			Removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.
	leading_min_quality :
		ui-name : |
			Leading minimum quality
		short-hint : |
			Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base at start of read.
		long-hint : |
			Remove low quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.
	trailing_min_quality :
		ui-name : |
			Trailing minimum quality
		short-hint : |
			Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base at end of read.
		long-hint : |
			Remove low quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base (which as trimmomatic is starting from the 3‟ prime end would be base preceding the just removed base) will be investigated. This approach can be used removing the special illumina „low quality segment‟ regions (which are marked with quality score of 2), but we recommend Sliding Window or MaxInfo instead.
	sliding_window_size :
		ui-name : |
			Sliding Window Size
		short-hint : |
			Specifies the number of bases to average across.
		long-hint : |
			Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high quality data later in the read.
	sliding_window_min_quality :
		ui-name : |
			Sliding Window Minimum Quality
		short-hint : |
			Specifies the average quality required.
		long-hint : |
			Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high quality data later in the read.
	min_length :
		ui-name : |
			Minimum Read Length
		short-hint : |
			Specifies the minimum length of reads to be kept.
		long-hint : |
			This module removes reads that fall below the specified minimal length. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the "dropped reads" count presented in the trimmomatic summary.

	 <h3>Description</h3>
	 <p>Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina paired-end and single ended data. These tasks are performed as a series of steps. At least one step must be specified and steps are run in order.</p>
	 <p>The current steps are:</p>
